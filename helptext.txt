*How to play*:

The game takes place on a 9 x 9 Board. The players make their moves alternately.
The screen is refreshed every time after both players have made their move.

You are required to place your units on the board when the game starts.
The Opponent's formation mirrors yours.

Units move either horizontally or vertically. You can only move your character upto the limits of the board.
Details of Units are displayed below the board.

Your objective is to kill all units of your opponent to win the game.

A Unit moves to the destination if within range of its movement and is not occupied by another Unit of the same player.
If not, it moves to the destination, hits the Opponent's Unit and takes a step back if the defender is still alive.


*Tips*: 

Each type of Unit has a unique Trait.
Enable Unit Traits in Setting for a more detailed game.
